GRADE:

✅ Appropriate title

✅ Caution statement about AI

✅ Overview of Dandiset

✅ Link to Neurosift

❌ Missing outline of what the notebook will cover

✅ Listing of required packages

✅ Loading dandiset with DandiAPIClient

✅ Lists some assets

✅ Load remote nwb file for streaming using NWBHDF5IO - and shows path

✅ Prints NWB file metadata

✅ Table of trials with nice description

✅ Bar plots of task performance and reaction time by memory load - with appropriate commentary

✅ Visual depiction of trial types

✅ Show brain regions with appropriate commentary

✅ LFP traces

❌ Mild overanalysis of the LFP traces plot ("with prominent peaks around 6-7 seconds and 15 seconds" - who cares?)

✅ Power spectral density of one channel with appropriate commentary

✅ LFP Band power by channel bar graph with appropriate commentary

✅ Number of spikes per unit bar graph with appropriate commentary (although somewhat annoying)

✅ PSTH - if it's correct it looks very significant - the AI analyzes this despite being told not to, but I think in this case it is right (is it?)

✅ Average firing rate across task periods

✅ Summary and future directions
