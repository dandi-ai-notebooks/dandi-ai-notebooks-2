✅ Bar plot of accuracy by probe type - and provides an accurate commentary

✅ LFP table and describes the columns

✅ LFP traces

❌ Overanalysis of the LFP traces plot

✅ Plot of LFP power spectrum -- with commentary

✅ Plots of power spectrum by trial trial phase

❌ Overanalysis of the power spectrum by trial trial phase plots
