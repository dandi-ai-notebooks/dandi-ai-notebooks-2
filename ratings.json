Also, units quality originally has an error as one of the qualities is not recognized and the loop through units[\"quality\"] breaks, so I added the .data[:] so it forces to read all the data. Finally, \"Center Visible\" is missing when plotting trial types counts and success by trial type, so I corrected the plots by adding the [1:] indexing to avoid the first bin which is 0.
