However, the y-axis label \"Event Amplitude (A.U.) + offset\" is a little confusing, as the offset isn't clearly defined. It would be better to state the offset value or explain how it's applied. Also, the \"spikyness\" of the data can make it difficult to interpret the underlying signal. I think a more detailed explanation in the caption would help the reader . Overall, the plot is good but could be improved with clearer labels and a potentially more refined visual representation of the data.\n\nscore: 4",

The plots are well-formatted, with clearly labeled axes and titles. There is nothing obviously wrong with this plot. However, some of the individual plots lack detailed ticks on the x axis (e.g. A1, A2, B3), and the distributions are very difficult to compare due to different x-axis ranges and y-axis ranges. I think the plot is \"very good\" but not publication quality. The x axis ranges need to be consistently scaled for easier comparison.",

Overall the plot is well-constructed and informative and could appear in a publication with perhaps a little more refinement in visual aesthetics. Given that, I would rate this a 4.\nThe only real issue is potentially the meaning and utility of the plot as it is not clear whether the depicted Power Spectral Density (PSD) is obtained from averaging several PSDs from different trials or channels (or both), or from a single trial. In addition, although the abscissa is labeled as frequency, it is not fully clear whether Welch's method or the FFT was used as a starting point for calculating the PSD. As these aspects concern the scientific interpretation and the methodology for presenting the PSD, they are therefore outside the rating of this plot, which is rated as a figure. In any case, one would need additional information to make a PSD more informative, such as adding information on the data collection process.",

No error bars: It would be helpful to see some measurement of spread (even standard deviation, or 95% confidence intervals) so one can see which differences in firing rates would be significant.\n2.  Raw Data: The plot shows what appear to be raw values, with many sharp jumps from one value to the next. It would be helpful for the data to be smoothed, which would make overall trends easier to see.\n3.  More Info on the Unit: A reader would like to some information on what unit 137 measures.
